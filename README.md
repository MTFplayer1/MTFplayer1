Hi I'm Hugo,
I'm a data science student (1st year masters) at SGH
I use GIT to post some random minor projects that I usually gave up on.
Also I'm looking for people to help me finish coding up some of my startup ideas. (email me at: hugopdmat@gmail.com)
My tech stack (by proficiency):
Python / R / SQL / C++ / Julia / HTML / JS

MTFplayer1/MTFplayer1 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
